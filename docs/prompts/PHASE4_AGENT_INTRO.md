Phase 4 Integration & Testing is ready to begin. All core components are deployed and operational: smart contracts on Base Sepolia, backend API on Railway, event indexer running 24/7, and frontend on Vercel. Your task is to execute comprehensive end-to-end testing of all 7 demo scenarios from DEMO_VIDEO.md, identify and fix any critical bugs, document results, and prepare the system for a flawless demo video recording.

Review `docs/phases/PHASE4_INTEGRATION_TESTING_PROMPT.md` for complete testing instructions, API endpoints, database schema, and success criteria. All Phase 1-3 completion reports are in the docs/ directory for reference.
