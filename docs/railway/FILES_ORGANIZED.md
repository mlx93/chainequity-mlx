# Railway Documentation Organization Summary

**Date**: November 5, 2025

## Files Organized

### Moved to `docs/railway/history/`
Historical Railway deployment documentation:
- `RAILWAY_DB_INITIALIZATION_ISSUE.md`
- `RAILWAY_DB_VERIFICATION.md`
- `RAILWAY_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md`
- `RAILWAY_SERVICES.md`
- `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md`
- `PROBLEM_SOLVED_SUMMARY.md`

### Moved to `docs/railway/reports/`
Phase 2B deployment reports:
- `PHASE2B_COMPLETE_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE2B_INDEXER_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE2B_INDEXER_SPECIALIST_PROMPT.md`
- `PHASE2B_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `PHASE2B_RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE2B_READY_TO_DEPLOY.md`
- `PHASE2B_SESSION_COMPLETE.md`

### Kept in `docs/railway/` (Root)
Core active documentation:
- `ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md` ⭐ - Orchestrator handoff
- `COMPLETE_SOLUTION.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` - Success report
- `SERVICES.md` - Service configuration
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- `RAILWAY_DATABASE_URLS.txt` - Database URLs
- `README.md` - Navigation guide
- `INDEX.md` - Quick reference

### Kept in `docs/railway/troubleshooting/`
Issue-specific troubleshooting guides:
- `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_FIX.md`
- `RAILWAY_DATABASE_FIX.md`
- `RAILWAY_INTERNAL_DNS_FIX.md`
- `PROJECT_MISMATCH_FIX.md`
- `DATABASE_URL_FIX.md`

## Root Level Files (Should Remain)

These files should stay at project root:
- `PROMPT_FOR_ORCHESTRATOR.md` - Quick reference for orchestrator
- Other non-Railway Phase 2B files (if any)

## Organization Rationale

1. **Active Docs**: Current guides and handoff documents in root `docs/railway/`
2. **History**: Completed issues/fixes moved to `history/` for reference
3. **Reports**: Phase 2B completion reports in `reports/` folder
4. **Troubleshooting**: Active troubleshooting guides in `troubleshooting/`

This structure keeps the root `docs/railway/` folder clean and focused on current, actionable documentation while preserving historical context.
