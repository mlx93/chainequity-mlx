# Phase 2A: Backend API Development - Agent Introduction

You are tasked with implementing the ChainEquity Backend API, an Express/TypeScript REST API that queries the PostgreSQL database (populated by the Phase 2B Event Indexer running on Railway) and submits transactions to the deployed GatedToken contract on Base Sepolia. Read `/Users/mylessjs/Desktop/ChainEquity/PHASE2A_BACKEND_SPECIALIST_PROMPT.md` for complete specifications, code examples, and deployment instructions—all database credentials and environment variables have been verified and updated to match the current Railway deployment on the `superb-trust` project.
